<p>I would suggest the following scheme.&nbsp;When a&nbsp;client obtains a copy of the circuit, it not only gets the current value of the circuit, it also gets a unique ticket number&nbsp;and a time. The&nbsp;circuit is considered checked out to the client for a length of time (say 5 minutes). If the client makes an update before that time is up, the update is accepted&nbsp;and the lease is renewed. After the lease has expired, updates will still be accepted as long as another client has not checked out the circuit in the mean time.</p>
<p>Server state (for each circuit):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>x -- The current value of the circuit</p>
  <p>k -- The latest ticket number</p>
  <p>t -- a time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Server algorithm:</p>
<pre>
Initially t is 0

While true do
	m := receive a message
	now := current time
	if m = checkout() and t < now
		k := new ticket,Â never used before
		t := now + 300 seconds
		reply with checkoutAccepted( t-now, k, x )
	else if m is a checkout message and t >= now
		// There is still a lease
		reply with checkoutRejected( t-now )
	else if m = update( x', k' ) and k' = k
		x := x'	
		t := now + 300 seconds
		reply with pack( t-now )
	else if m =&nbsp;update( x', k' ) and k' /= k
		if  t &lt; now  
			x := x'
			k := k'
			t := now + 300 seconds
			reply with updateAccepted(t-now, k)
		else 
			reply with updateRejected( t-now )
	else if m =&nbsp;release( k' ) and k' = k
	&nbsp;	t := now
		reply with releaseAccepted( 0 )
	else if m = release( k' ) and k' /= k
		reply with releaseAccepted( 0 )

</pre>
<p>The client behaves as follows</p>

<h2>Domain model and definitions</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Circuit</dt>
  <dd>A circuit is&nbsp;a named arrangement of components and links. Copies of circuits exist on one or more clients and on the server</dd>
  <dt>Circuit Diagram</dt>
  <dd>A circuit diagram is a visual representation of a circuit. There may be multiple diagrams of the same circuit. For example if circuit A contains two compount components that both have the same kind and that both refer to circuit B, then the diagram of circuit A will contain two diagrams of circuit B. The two circuit diagrams may show different values for the same links.</dd>
  <dt>Component</dt>
  <dd>A component is an instantiaion of a component kind. Each component belongs to a single circuit.&nbsp; Each component has a number of attributes that can be edited. Attributes of components include a position (x,y), size (w, h),  orientation.&nbsp; (North, South, East, West), and flip (Up or Down). Depending on the component kind, components may have other attributes. For example, a component whose kind is and-gate would have attribute indicating the number of inputs. A component whose component kind is compound&nbsp;has an attribute saying whether it is white-box or black-box.&nbsp; Most primitive components have an attribute for the delay.&nbsp; A flip-flop component might have attributes for set-up and hold times. (Implementation note: the state of a Component does not include any information associated with Simulations.)</dd>
  <dt>Component kind</dt>
  <dd>A component kind defines how components appear, what attributes they have, the types of those attributes, and how the components behave during simulation. Components kinds are either&nbsp;primitive or compound.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Implementation note: in the implementation, circuit kinds have no mutable state. All mutable state&nbsp;associated is associated with the Component. The exception is for Compound components, q.v.)</dd>
  <dt>Primitive Component&nbsp;Kind</dt>
  <dd>Primitive component kinds&nbsp;are things such and gate, not&nbsp;gates, adders,&nbsp;etc., that are build in.</dd>
  <dt>Compound Component Kind</dt>
  <dd>Compound component kinds are little other than references to circuits. For each Circuit there is a corresponding component kind.&nbsp; When the circuit&nbsp;that a compound component refers to changes, the compound component kind changes implicitly. See discussion below: in <a href="onCompoundComponentKinds">section On Compound Component Kinds.</a> </dd>
  <dt>Port</dt>
  <dd>A Port is the representation of an input or output to a component. Each Port is associated with a component.&nbsp; Each Port is either an in port or an outport.&nbsp; Ports may have names.&nbsp;The number of input and output ports and their names are generally determined by the component kind.&nbsp; For example any D-flip-flop would have two Input Ports named D and CLK and one Output Port named Q. However some Component&nbsp;Kinds will allow variable numbers&nbsp;of Input or Output Ports: for example a gate would allow a variable number of Input Ports with a minumum of 2.&nbsp; The location of a port is determined by the Kind and the Component.&nbsp;For example the Kind might determine what side a port is on. Typically the inputs are on the &quot;left&quot;, &quot;top&quot; or &quot;bottom&quot; side, while outputs are on the &quot;right&quot;. (&quot;Left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;top&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot; are assuming the orientation is the default &quot;east&quot; and the flip is the default &quot;up&quot;.) Ports that are not Connected to anything links could be displayed in dark orange.</dd>
  <dt>Input Port</dt>
  <dd>A Port used for input.&nbsp; Input ports might be represented by small squares&nbsp;with black stroke and white fills. </dd>
  <dd>&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt>Output Port</dt>
  <dd>A Port used for output. Output ports might be represented by small squares with black stroke and gray fill.</dd>
  <dt>Links</dt>
  <dd>A link&nbsp;is a wire with two endpoints. The endpoints should be shown as small  coloured circles with white centres when not connected. Endpoints that are connected to ports are not shown at all. Endpoints that are connected to links are shown as coloured circles that are filled. The Link itself is shown as a straight  line.&nbsp; (Although where two links cross, on might be shown in a way that indicates that the links are not connected. The colour of the Link and its endpoints is by default black. If there is an active Simulation the colour may be determined by the state of the Simulation.&nbsp;</dd>
  <dt>Connected</dt>
  <dd>A Link is directly Connected to a&nbsp;port if one of its end points&nbsp;has the same World Coordiates as the port.&nbsp; Two different Links are directly Connected to each other if they they have end points at the same World Coordinates if one has an end point that is on the line formed by the other.&nbsp; Two ports, two links, or a port and a link are Connected to each other if they are either Directly Connected or connected by 1 or more intermediary links.&nbsp; Also every Port and Link is connected to itself. The&nbsp;relation of being connected is thus transitive (if a~b and b~c then a~c), symmetric (if a~b then b~a), and reflexive (a~a).</dd>
  <dt>Net</dt>
  <dd>A maximal set of Ports and Links that are all connected to each other is called a Net.&nbsp; Note that each Port and Link is a member of exactly one Net. (Implementation note:&nbsp; There is no need to represent Nets explicitely. However, it will be useful for simulation if we can calculate the Net of a Port or Link.</dd>
  <dt>World coordinates</dt>
  <dd>Each Circuit Diagram is laid out on a rectagle of the real plane.&nbsp; This rectangle has x coordinates from 0 to W and y coordinates from 0 to H.</dd>

<h2>UI</h2>
<h3>Layout of the  UI</h3>
<h4>Main screen</h4>
<p>Along the top&nbsp;of the client screen is tool bar that contains buttons for the various command.</p>
<p>To the right is a tool bar (or pallette) that contains icons representing various tools. This will include tools for the most common component kinds.</p>
<p>In the middle, is the drawing canvas containing a visualization of the circuit being edited.&nbsp;Above the canvas is the name of the current circuit. The canvas is surrounded by four buttons for scrolling the canvas.</p>
<p>During simulation, the bottom part of the main screen contains the simulation panel.</p>
<h3>Selection model</h3>
<p>At each point in time a set of components and links on each  diagram are considered selected.</p>
<h3>Use cases for editing</h3>
<h4>Add component by drag and drop</h4>
<p>Requirements: Add components to a circuit diagram.</p>
<p>Actors: The user and the client</p>
<p>Precondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Postcondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Basic Flow</p>
<ol>
  <li>User: May scroll the palette so that the appropriate item is displayed.</li>
  <li>User: Moves mouse over a palette item&nbsp;and depresses the mouse.</li>
  <li>User: Drags mouse to the drawing canvas.</li>
  <li>Client: As long as the mouse is over the palette or drawing canvas, as preview of the component is shown.</li>
  <li>User: Releases the mouse over the drawing canvas.</li>
  <li>Client: Adds the component to the diagram.</li>
  <li>Client: The newly added component becomes the selected component.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In step 2 the palette items should light up as the mouse passes over them.</li>
  <li>The component might actually be added to the drawing as soon as the mouse moves over the canvas.</li>
  <li>On a touch device, the drag may be done with touch event rather than mouse events.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Add component by click or tap</h4>
<p>Requirements: Add components to a circuit diagram.</p>
<p>Actors: The user and the client</p>
<p>Precondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Postcondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Basic Flow</p>
<ol>
  <li>User: May scroll the palette so that the appropriate item is displayed.</li>
  <li>User: Moves mouse over a palette item&nbsp;and clicks with the mouse.</li>
  <li>Client: Adds the component to the diagram&nbsp;at world coordinates that correspond to the center of the view coordinates.</li>
  <li>Client: The newly added component becomes the selected component.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In step 2 the palette items should light up as the mouse passes over them.</li>
  <li>On a touch device, as tap can be used instead of a mouse click.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Move components, links, and endpoints by drag</h4>
<p>Requirements: Move components around the circuit diagram.</p>
<p>Actors: The user and the client</p>
<p>Precondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Postcondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Basic Flow</p>
<ol>
  <li>User: Depresses mouse button over a component, link, or endpoint.</li>
  <li>User: Moves mouse to another part of the diagram.</li>
  <li>If the component, link, or&nbsp;the link that the endpoint belongs to is in the current selection:
    <ol>
      <li>Client: As the mouse moves,&nbsp;all selected links and components also move.</li>
      <li>When the mouse is released the selection is unchanged</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Otherwise
    <ol>
      <li>Client: As the mouse moves, the component, link, or endpoint moves.</li>
      <li>When the mouse is released, the component, link, or the link that the endpoint belongs to become the only&nbsp;selected thing.</li>
      <li>When a component moves, all endpoints connected to its ports should also move.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On a touch device, touch events can be used.</li>
  <li>Disambiguating a mouse down should be done as follows: Endpoints have top priority, then links, then components.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rotate components</h4>
<p>Requirements: As a user I will be able to rotate components</p>
<p>Actors: The user and the client</p>
<p>Precondition: The client is in editing mode&nbsp;and one or more components are selected.</p>
<p>Postcondition: The client is in editing mode.</p>
<p>Basic Flow</p>
<ol>
  <li>User: clicks on the rotate button.</li>
  <li>Client: rotates all selected components by 90 degrees.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rotation is roughly around the geometric centre of each component.</li>
  <li>As components rotate, the&nbsp;position of  ports will likely change. And connected endpoints will also change position.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<h3><a name="onCompoundComponentKinds"></a>On compound component kinds</h3>
<p>One issue with compound component kinds is that they must not be allowed to form a cycle. I.e. we can not add to Circuit A a Component whose Kind is a compound kind that refers directly or indirectly to Circuit A.</p>
<p>When the circuit&nbsp;that a compound component refers to changes, the compound component kind changes implicitly. For example: Suppose Circuit A contains two Components A.0&nbsp;and A.1 that are of the same Compound Component Kind&nbsp;that refers to another Circuit B.&nbsp; If B changes, then Components A.0 and A.1 may become invalid, for example the number of input and output ports that they have may need to be adjusted.&nbsp; Furthermore if the component shows a white-box view, then Circuit A will have to be re-rendered even if the attributes of its components haven't changed. From an implementation point of view, this can be accomodated by two measures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First when the Circuit is opened for editing, all its components need to be validated. Validating a component means checking that it has the right number of input ports with the right names and positions, that it has the right set of output ports with the right set of names and positions, and possibly updating attribute and their values that are derived from the kind.</li>
  <li>Second, when a Circuit is changed, any component in an open Circuit that refers to that Circuit needs to be validated.&nbsp; This can be accomplished by the observer pattern.&nbsp; For example: suppose Circuit A is open and has a component A.1 that refers to a Circuit B. A.1 observes B. Thus when B is changes, it notifies A.1 which then validates itself.&nbsp;Whether or not&nbsp;A.1 was invalid, the change to B is a change to A and so A notifies its observers that it has changed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>On client copies and server copies</h2>
<p>Note that while Circuits  are stored on the server, a client may obtain a copy of a Circuit for editing&nbsp;or simulation. We need to avoid the&nbsp;problem that two clients might try to edit the same circuit at the same time.&nbsp; Conflicting edits must be resolved in some way. The simplest way to resolve conflicts is that the most recent update prevails, even if it overwrites changes from another client.&nbsp; <a href="concurrentEditing.html">Elsewhere</a>&nbsp;I'll discuss a scheme that allows concurrent editing.</p>
